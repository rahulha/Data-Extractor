# Data-Extractor
This a simple data extractor/text parser I created for one of my professor. You can go to CharityNavigator website. Download any of the annual reports and then copy of the text. Paste into given Text area of this tool. This tool will then parse the text and store it into an excel file. I created for my professor to let her extract data from charity navigator. This tool helped us to collect non-profit organization financial data much more fast. Where a person can copy paste data in 15 mins for 1 company, this tool reduced it to 30-45 seconds.
